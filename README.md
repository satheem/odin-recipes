This project is part of [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/) curriculum. The objective is to create a simple recipe website that displays multiple recipes with detailed instructions and ingredient lists. The website allows users to view, navigate, and explore different recipes.

2. **Pasta**
3. **Salad**

Each recipe has its own page, with a list of ingredients and instructions for preparation.
